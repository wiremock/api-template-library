name: "Interzoid Get Full Name Parsed Match Similarity Key API"
provider: "interzoid.com"
description: "This API provides a similarity key used to match with other similar\
  \ full name data when data fields are parsed into first name and last name components,\
  \ including for purposes of deduplication, fuzzy matching, or merging of datasets.\
  \ A much higher match rate will be achieved by matching on the similarity key rather\
  \ than the data itself. This API is for full name data where first and last name\
  \ are in separate fields. Use the Full Name Similarity Key API for first and last\
  \ name data that are in the same field."
