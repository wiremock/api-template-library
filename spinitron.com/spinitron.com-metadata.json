For web integration using iframes and/or JavaScript instead of an API, see [https://spinitron.github.io/v2-web-integration/](https://spinitron.github.io/v2-web-integration/).\n\n**Your API key** is found in the Spinitron web app. Log in to Spinitron and go to *Automation & API* in the *Admin* menu.\n\n**Authenticate** by presenting your API key using either HTTP Bearer Authorization\n(preferred)\n\n    curl -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOURAPIKEY' 'https://spinitron.com/api/spins'\n\nor in the query parameter `access-token` (less secure owing to webserver\nlog files)\n\n    curl 'https://spinitron.com/api/spins?access-token=YOURAPIKEY'\n\n**Limit** per page of results is 20 by default and miximally 200.\n\n**Try it out** below works to\ngenerate example cURL requests but not to get responses from Spinitron. We\ndo not accept queries sent from web browsers. Copy-paste the cURL commands\nand run them from your computer.\n\n**Cache** the data you get from the API if you are using it in web or mobile integration. It's not ok to query the API on *every* page request you serve. The [demo](https://spinitron.com/v2-api-demo/) shows how easy it can be to implement a file cache.\n\nAn extension to this API with access to all stations for partner applications is available. Contact us.\n","logo":"spinitron.com-logo.png","logoMediaType":"image/png","tags":[{"name":"media"}],"stubs":"spinitron.com-stubs.json"}
