{"slug":"microsoft-com-cognitiveservices-VisualSearch","name":"Visual Search Client","provider":"microsoft.com","description":"Visual Search API lets you discover insights about an image such as visually similar images, shopping sources, and related searches. The API can also perform text recognition, identify entities (people, places, things), return other topical content for the user to explore, and more. For more information, see [Visual Search Overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/bing-visual-search/overview).  **NOTE:** To comply with the new EU Copyright Directive in France, the Bing Visual Search API must omit some content from certain EU News sources for French users. The removed content may include thumbnail images and videos, video previews, and snippets which accompany search results from these sources. As a consequence, the Bing APIs may serve fewer results with thumbnail images and videos, video previews, and snippets to French users.","logo":"microsoft.com-cognitiveservices-VisualSearch-logo.png","logoMediaType":"image/png","tags":[{"name":"developer_tools"},{"name":"cloud"}],"stubs":"microsoft.com-cognitiveservices-VisualSearch-stubs.json"}
