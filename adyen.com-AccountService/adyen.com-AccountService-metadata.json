{"slug":"adyen-com-AccountService","name":"adyen.com:AccountService","title":"Account API","description":"This API is used for the classic integration. If you are just starting your implementation, refer to our [new integration guide](https://docs.adyen.com/marketplaces-and-platforms) instead.\n\nThe Account API provides endpoints for managing account-related entities on your platform. These related entities include account holders, accounts, bank accounts, shareholders, and verification-related documents. The management operations include actions such as creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion of them.\n\nFor more information, refer to our [documentation](https://docs.adyen.com/marketplaces-and-platforms/classic).\n## Authentication\nYour Adyen contact will provide your API credential and an API key. To connect to the API, add an `X-API-Key` header with the API key as the value, for example:\n\n ```\ncurl\n-H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n-H \"X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY\" \\\n...\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can use the username and password to connect to the API using basic authentication. For example:\n\n```\ncurl\n-U \"ws@MarketPlace.YOUR_PLATFORM_ACCOUNT\":\"YOUR_WS_PASSWORD\" \\\n-H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n...\n```\nWhen going live, you need to generate new web service user credentials to access the [live endpoints](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/live-endpoints).\n\n## Versioning\nThe Account API supports [versioning](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/versioning) using a version suffix in the endpoint URL. This suffix has the following format: \"vXX\", where XX is the version number.\n\nFor example:\n```\nhttps://cal-test.adyen.com/cal/services/Account/v6/createAccountHolder\n```","logo":"adyen.com-AccountService-logo.svg","logoMediaType":"image/svg+xml","tags":[{"name":"payment"}],"stubs":"adyen.com-AccountService-stubs.json"}
