description: "Space has a hostile radiation environment that increases the risk of\
  \ cancers in humans and malfunctions in spacecraft electronics. The types of space\
  \  radiation of primary concern are:\n  <ul>\n    <li>\n        Galactic Cosmic\
  \ Rays from outside our solar system generated by \n        supernovae and other\
  \ phenomena;\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Solar Energetic Particles produced by\
  \ the Sun during intense and\n        sporadic bursts of activity; and\n    </li>\n\
  \    <li>\n        Trapped Radiation: energetic particles confined by Earth's magnetic\n\
  \        field, usually comprising an inner belt of mostly high energy protons \n\
  \        and an outer belt dominated by lower energy electrons and plasma.\n   \
  \ </li>\n  </ul> \n\nUnderstanding the space radiation environment for a particular\
  \ mission profile is becoming increasingly important. Commercial off-the-shelf electronic\
  \ components  that aren't resilient to space radiation are now prevalent. Longer\
  \ duration  missions to cislunar space, Mars, and beyond are placing astronauts\
  \ at greater  risk of radiation exposure. <br><br>\nAPI requests must contain a\
