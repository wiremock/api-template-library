description: "<fullname>Amazon Simple Workflow Service</fullname> <p>The Amazon Simple\
  \ Workflow Service (Amazon SWF) makes it easy to build applications that use Amazon's\
  \ cloud to coordinate work across distributed components. In Amazon SWF, a <i>task</i>\
  \ represents a logical unit of work that is performed by a component of your workflow.\
  \ Coordinating tasks in a workflow involves managing intertask dependencies, scheduling,\
  \ and concurrency in accordance with the logical flow of the application.</p> <p>Amazon\
  \ SWF gives you full control over implementing tasks and coordinating them without\
  \ worrying about underlying complexities such as tracking their progress and maintaining\
  \ their state.</p> <p>This documentation serves as reference only. For a broader\
  \ overview of the Amazon SWF programming model, see the <i> <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonswf/latest/developerguide/\"\
  >Amazon SWF Developer Guide</a> </i>.</p>"
