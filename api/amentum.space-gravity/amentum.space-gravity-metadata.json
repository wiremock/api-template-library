  "description" : "The gravitational field of the earth is non-uniform.  The <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoid'>geoid</a> is the shape the\n ocean surface would take if only gravity and the rotation of the Earth\n  were considered. The geoid is the surface that defines zero elevation.<br><br>\n\nThe geoid height is the difference between an ideal reference ellipsoid  and the geoid.<br><br>\nThe gravity anomaly is the difference between the acceleration due to gravity on the Earth's surface and the value calculated assuming the reference ellipsoid.<br><br>\nThe official Earth Gravitational Model <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_Gravitational_Model#EGM2008/>EGM2008</a> was developed and  released to the public by the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA).<br><br>\nOur EGM2008 API provides on-demand access to the EGM2008 model, as implemented by the open-source GeographicLib  <a href=https://geographiclib.sourceforge.io/html/gravity.html>Gravity</a> library.<br><br>\nAPI requests must contain a key \"API-Key\" in the header (see code samples).
