description: "NamSor API v2 : enpoints to process personal names (gender, cultural\
  \ origin or ethnicity) in all alphabets or languages. By default, enpoints use 1\
  \ unit per name (ex. Gender), but Ethnicity classification uses 10 to 20 units per\
  \ name depending on taxonomy. Use GET methods for small tests, but prefer POST methods\
  \ for higher throughput (batch processing of up to 100 names at a time). Need something\
  \ you can't find here? We have many more features coming soon. Let us know, we'll\
  \ do our best to add it! "
