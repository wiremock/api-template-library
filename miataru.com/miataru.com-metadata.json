{"slug":"miataru-com","name":"Miataru","provider":"miataru.com","description":"The Miataru API is very simple and straight forward. Generally you're posting (HTTP POST) a JSON formatted request to a service method locations and you get back a JSON formatted answer. Please take into consideration that this has the request-for-comment status and that it can change while there's work done on client and server applications. Versioning therefore is done by prepending the version number - /v1/ for version 1 - to the method call.","logo":"miataru.com-logo.png","logoMediaType":"image/png","tags":[{"name":"location"}],"stubs":"miataru.com-stubs.json"}
