description: "API Reference: <br><br> The StatSocial API is organized around REST.\
  \ Our API is designed to have predictable, resource-oriented URLs and to use HTTP\
  \ response codes to indicate API errors. We use built-in HTTP features, like HTTP\
  \ authentication and HTTP verbs, which can be understood by off-the-shelf HTTP clients,\
  \ and we support cross-origin resource sharing to allow you to interact securely\
  \ with our API from a client-side web application (remember that you should never\
  \ expose your secret API key in any public website's client-side code). JSON will\
  \ be returned in all responses from the API, including errors (though if you're\
  \ using API bindings, we will convert the response to the appropriate language-specific\
  \ object).<br><br>Contact help@statsocial.com to obtain a test API key"
