It is short-lived (~1 day) and may change unexpectedly (with a sync, change in homegraph, etc.)\n##### Get this token\n- With access to an android device, [get this token directly by either method](https://gist.github.com/rithvikvibhu/1a0f4937af957ef6a78453e3be482c1f).\n- Without a device, or to integrate it with a script, use an access token to get the homegraph and extract the token. To get an access token, read the next section. Check the example section for more info.\n\n### Access Token\nThis is a standard google oauth2 access token. It is in the form `ya29.***`.\nThis gives access to the Google Home Foyer API. These expire in an hour.\nUse this to get the homegraph (and then the local authorization token above).\n##### Get this token\nTo get this access token, either a Google account username/password or a Google Master Token is needed. More info in the gist.\nUse the script [from this gist](https://gist.github.com/rithvikvibhu/952f83ea656c6782fbd0f1645059055d).\n\n### Master Token\nThis is in the form `aas_et/***` and can be used to request access tokens.\n##### Get this token\nThe same [script in the gist](https://gist.github.com/rithvikvibhu/952f83ea656c6782fbd0f1645059055d) that gets the access token can also get the master token. Needs Google account creds.\n\n## Example\n\nHere's the whole flow from just a pair of username/password to using the local API.\n\nPrerequisites:\n- [grpcurl](https://github.com/fullstorydev/grpcurl)\n- [Proto files](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1RvnN3y-G23pd2SWHmfV_7sef8QU5GNF4?usp=sharing) (preserve folder structure)\n\n### 1. Get an access token with the script\n- Download get_tokens.py\n- Fill in username and password\n```sh\npython3 get_tokens.py\n# Note down the access token printed.\n```\n\n### 2. Use the access token and get home graph\n- This prints the json and uses jq to parse and filter out the fields deviceName and localAuthToken\n- This will give a list of all devices and their local auth tokens\n```sh\n./grpcurl -H 'authorization: Bearer ya29.a0Af****' \\\n\t-import-path /path/to/protos \\\n\t-proto /path/to/protos/google/internal/home/foyer/v1.proto \\\n\tgooglehomefoyer-pa.googleapis.com:443 \\\n\tgoogle.internal.home.foyer.v1.StructuresService/GetHomeGraph | jq '.home.devices[] | {deviceName, localAuthToken}'\n# Note down the local auth token for the device you want.\n```\n\n### 3. Make the call to the local device using the local auth token\n```sh\ncurl -H \"cast-local-authorization-token: LOCAL_AUTH_TOKEN\" --verbose --insecure https://192.168.0.18:8443/setup/bluetooth/status\n```","logo":"google.home-logo.svg","logoMediaType":"image/svg+xml","tags":[],"stubs":"google.home-stubs.json"}
