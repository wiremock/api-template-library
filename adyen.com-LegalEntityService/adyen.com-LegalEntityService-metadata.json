{"slug":"adyen-com-LegalEntityService","name":"adyen.com:LegalEntityService","title":"Legal Entity Management API","description":"The Legal Entity Management API enables you to manage legal entities that contain information required for verification. \n## Authentication\nTo connect to the Legal Entity Management API, you must use the basic authentication credentials of your web service user. If you don't have one, contact the [Adyen Support Team](https://www.adyen.help/hc/en-us/requests/new). Use the web service user credentials to authenticate your request, for example:\n\n```\ncurl\n-U \"ws12345@Scope.BalancePlatform_YourBalancePlatform\":\"YourWsPassword\" \\\n-H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n...\n```\nNote that when going live, you need to generate new web service user credentials to access the [live endpoints](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/live-endpoints).\n\n## Versioning\nThe Legal Entity Management API supports versioning of its endpoints through a version suffix in the endpoint URL. This suffix has the following format: \"vXX\", where XX is the version number.\n\nFor example:\n```\nhttps://kyc-test.adyen.com/lem/v3/legalEntities\n```\n## Going live\nWhen going live, your Adyen contact will provide your API credential for the live environment. You can then use the username and password to send requests to `https://kyc-live.adyen.com/lem/v3`.\n\n","logo":"adyen.com-LegalEntityService-logo.svg","logoMediaType":"image/svg+xml","tags":[{"name":"payment"}],"stubs":"adyen.com-LegalEntityService-stubs.json"}
