A couple of the key benefits of using the Nookipedia API is access to data spanning the entire *Animal Crossing* series, as well as information that is constantly updated and expanding as editors work on the wiki.<br><br>Access to the Nookipedia API requires obtaining a key. This is so we can manage our scale and provide better support for our users. To request access to the API, please fill out [this form](https://forms.gle/wLwtXLerKhfDrRLY8).<br><br>This API is 'version 2' of our [original API](https://nookipedia.com/api/).
