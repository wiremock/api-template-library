  \ developers who need detailed information about Amazon Fraud Detector API actions,\
  \ data types, and errors. For more information about Amazon Fraud Detector features,\
  \ see the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/frauddetector/latest/ug/\">Amazon\
  \ Fraud Detector User Guide</a>.</p> <p>We provide the Query API as well as AWS\
  \ software development kits (SDK) for Amazon Fraud Detector in Java and Python programming\
  \ languages.</p> <p>The Amazon Fraud Detector Query API provides HTTPS requests\
  \ that use the HTTP verb GET or POST and a Query parameter <code>Action</code>.\
  \ AWS SDK provides libraries, sample code, tutorials, and other resources for software\
  \ developers who prefer to build applications using language-specific APIs instead\
  \ of submitting a request over HTTP or HTTPS. These libraries provide basic functions\
  \ that automatically take care of tasks such as cryptographically signing your requests,\
  \ retrying requests, and handling error responses, so that it is easier for you\
  \ to get started. For more information about the AWS SDKs, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https:/aws.amazon.com/tools/\"\
  >Tools to build on AWS</a>. </p>"
