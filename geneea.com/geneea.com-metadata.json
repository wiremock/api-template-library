An example\n        of such information would be the language of text or a particular text extractor for URL resources.\n    </p>\n    <p>The supported types of analyses are:</p>\n    <ul>\n        <li><strong>lemmatization</strong> &longrightarrow;\n            Finds out lemmata (basic forms) of all the words in the document.\n        </li>\n        <li><strong>correction</strong> &longrightarrow;\n            Performs correction (diacritization) on all the words in the document.\n        </li>\n        <li><strong>topic detection</strong> &longrightarrow;\n            Determines a topic of the document, e.g. finance or sports.\n        </li>\n        <li><strong>sentiment analysis</strong> &longrightarrow;\n            Determines a sentiment of the document, i.e. how positive or negative the document is.\n        </li>\n        <li><strong>named entity recognition</strong> &longrightarrow;\n            Finds named entities (like person, location, date etc.) mentioned the the document.\n        </li>\n    </ul>\n\n    <h2>Encoding</h2>\n    <p>The supplied text is expected to be in UTF-8 encoding, this is especially important for non-english texts.</p>\n\n    <h2>Returned values</h2>\n    <p>The API calls always return objects in serialized JSON format in UTF-8 encoding.</p>\n    <p>\n        If any error occurs, the HTTP response code will be in the range <code>4xx</code> (client-side error) or\n        <code>5xx</code> (server-side error). In this situation, the body of the response will contain information\n        about the error in JSON format, with <code>exception</code> and <code>message</code> values.\n    </p>\n\n    <h2>URL limitations</h2>\n    <p>\n        All the requests are semantically <code>GET</code>. However, for longer texts, you may run into issues\n        with URL length limit. Therefore, it's possible to always issue a <code>POST</code> request with all\n        the parameters encoded as a JSON in the request body.\n    </p>\n    <p>Example:</p>\n    <pre><code>\n        POST /s1/sentiment\n        Content-Type: application/json\n\n        {\"text\":\"There is no harm in being sometimes wrong - especially if one is promptly found out.\"}\n    </code></pre>\n    <p>This is equivalent to <code>GET /s1/sentiment?text=There%20is%20no%20harm...</code></p>\n\n    <h2>Request limitations</h2>\n    <p>\n        The API has other limitations concerning the size of the HTTP requests. The maximum allowed size of any\n        POST request body is <em>512 KiB</em>. For request with a URL resource, the maximum allowed number of\n        extracted characters from each such resource is <em>100,000</em>.\n    </p>\n\n    <h2>Terms of Service</h2>\n    <p>\n        By using the API, you agree to our\n        <a href=\"https://www.geneea.com/terms.html\" target=\"_blank\">Terms of Service Agreement</a>.\n    </p>\n\n    <h2>More information</h2>\n    <p>\n        <a href=\"https://help.geneea.com/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n        The Interpretor Public Documentation\n        </a>\n    </p>\n</div>\n","logo":"geneea.com-logo.png","logoMediaType":"image/png","tags":[{"name":"text"}],"stubs":"geneea.com-stubs.json"}
