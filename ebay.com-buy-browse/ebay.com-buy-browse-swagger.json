This field is only returned if the eBay partner enables affiliate tracking for the item by including the X-EBAY-C-ENDUSERCTX request header in the method.

This ID is changed only when the seller makes a change to the item. This means you cannot use this value to determine if the quantity has changed.

See topRatedBuyingExperience for more information. price - This is tracked by the revision ID but is returned here to enable you to quickly verify the price of the item. estimatedAvailabilities - Returns the item availability information, which is based on the item's quantity. Note: Changes in quantity are not tracked by sellerItemRevision. itemEndDate - This is the scheduled end time of the listing. eligibleForInlineCheckout - This parameter returns items based on whether or not the items can be purchased using the Buy Order API.
