Our end-to-end solution allows you to\nlocalize your items/assets based on technologies such as RFID and Bluetooth.\n\n# Try it out!\n\nThe API can be tried out and tested using the ['api-doc/tryitout' endpoint on this site](./tryitout/).\nThis UI allows anyone to visualize and interact with the API’s resources without having any of the implementation logic in place.\nIt’s automatically generated from this Specification, with the visual documentation making it easy for back end implementation and client side consumption.\n\n# Authentication\n\nApplications are required to provide some form of authentication to the API\nfor every secured endpoint.
