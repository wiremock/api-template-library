{"slug":"adyen-com-PayoutService","name":"adyen.com:PayoutService","title":"Adyen Payout API","description":"A set of API endpoints that allow you to store payout details, confirm, or decline a payout.\n\nFor more information, refer to [Online payouts](https://docs.adyen.com/online-payments/online-payouts).\n## Authentication\nTo use the Payout API, you need to have [two API credentials](https://docs.adyen.com/online-payments/online-payouts#payouts-to-bank-accounts-and-wallets): one for storing payout details and submitting payouts, and another one for confirming or declining payouts. If you don't have the required API credentials, contact our [Support Team](https://www.adyen.help/hc/en-us/requests/new).\n\nBoth of these API credentials must be authenticated with [basic authentication](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/api-credentials#basic-authentication).The following example shows how to authenticate your request when submitting a payout:\n\n```\ncurl\n-U \"storePayout@Company.YOUR_COMPANY_ACCOUNT\":\"YOUR_BASIC_AUTHENTICATION_PASSWORD\" \\\n-H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n...\n```\n\n## Versioning\nPayments API supports [versioning](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/versioning) using a version suffix in the endpoint URL. This suffix has the following format: \"vXX\", where XX is the version number.\n\nFor example:\n```\nhttps://pal-test.adyen.com/pal/servlet/Payout/v68/payout\n```\n\n## Going live\n\nTo authenticate to the live endpoints, you need [API credentials](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/api-credentials) from your live Customer Area.\n\nThe live endpoint URLs contain a prefix which is unique to your company account:\n```\n\nhttps://{PREFIX}-pal-live.adyenpayments.com/pal/servlet/Payout/v68/payout\n```\n\nGet your `{PREFIX}` from your live Customer Area under **Developers** > **API URLs** > **Prefix**.","logo":"adyen.com-PayoutService-logo.svg","logoMediaType":"image/svg+xml","tags":[{"name":"payment"}],"stubs":"adyen.com-PayoutService-stubs.json"}
