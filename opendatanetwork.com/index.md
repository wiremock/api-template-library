description: "The Socrata OpenDataNetwork (ODN) REST API exposes public data, often\
  \ continuosly updated and enhanced, from many thousands of public\ngovernment and\
  \ non profit agencies.\n\nMuch of this data originating from independent sources\
  \ is fused together to create new, and often\npowerful, entity level data. The API,\
  \ in addition to search and autosuggest capabilities for finding datasets,\nenables\
  \ data based comparisons across geographical regions such as states, counties, metropolitan\
  \ areas,\ncities and zip codes using highly vetted data providers such as US Census,\
  \ BEA, HUD and others. Comparison data\nis preformatted for easy and efficient display\
  \ on a chart, graph or interactive map.\n\nThe API also exposes data organized by\
  \ narrative style questions a human might ask. The questions can\nbe rapidly found\
  \ using an autosuggest style index, and then used to directly access all data needed\
  \ to\nthoroughly and authoritatively answer the question. Retrieved data includes\
  \ time series (temporally aligned),\ntabular, map heavy (includes spatial boundaries),\
  \ and auto generated unstructured descriptive text.\n\nThe ODN API does not duplicate\
  \ API endpoints or services provided by public sector agencies, but rather,\nreturns\
  \ context relevant pre-populated REST URLs, when appropriate, so the caller can\
  \ access data\ndirectly from the source.\n\nThe [open source](http://github.com/socrata/odn-backend)\
  \ API powers [OpenDataNetwork.com](http://OpenDataNetwork.com), an [open source](http://github.com/socrata/opendatanetwork.com)\n\
  site; the site highlights myriad uses and provides API badges with contextually\
  \ relevant API example\nREST endpoints and documentation pointers.\n\nFinally, we\
  \ continuously add new dat sources which appear automatically in the API, so if\
  \ your favorite data\nsource is not available, check back soon. You can also join\
  \ us [HERE](http://www.opendatanetwork.com/join-open-data-network)\nand receive\
  \ updates or let us know which data sources you are most interested in.\n\n## App\
  \ Tokens\n\nRegistering for and including a [Socrata application token](https://dev.socrata.com/docs/app-tokens.html)\n\
  is _required_ for the ODN API. They can be passed either using the `app_token` parameter\n\
  or the `X-App-Token` HTTP header."
