description: "The SEDRA API is documented in **OpenAPI format** and uses [ReDoc](https://github.com/Rebilly/ReDoc)\
  \ for documentation.\n# Introduction\nThis document describes the JSON API for the\
  \ Syriac Electronic Data Research Archive (SEDRA). The SEDRA project is a linguistic\
  \ and literary database of Syriac language and literature focusing on providing\
  \ electronic access to the corpus of Syriac lexicons with linguistic information\
  \ added to each entry in those lexicons. The API is a mechanism to provide the linguistic\
  \ information stored in SEDRA to a broader audience.\nAdditionally there is a XML\
  \ API for Syriac words which conforms to a prototype Semitic Languages schema which\
  \ can be found in the XSD file https://sedra.bethmardutho.org/api/semiticLanguages.xsd.\n\
  # Cross-Origin Resource Sharing\nThis API features Cross-Origin Resource Sharing\
  \ (CORS) implemented in compliance with the [W3C spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/cors/)\
  \ and allows cross-domain communication from the browser.\nAll responses have a\
  \ wildcard same-origin which makes them completely public and accessible to everyone,\
  \ including any code on any site.\n# Samples\nExplaining how to lookup words in\
  \ the SEDRA API is complex and would clutter the API description. For that reason\
  \ we have chosen to give the explanation of how to lookup words in its own section.\
  \ SEDRA can lookup words by the SEDRA word Id. However, it will often be the case\
  \ that the consumer of information provided by the SEDRA API does not know the SEDRA\
  \ word Id. It is for that reason that the SEDRA API provides a method to lookup\
  \ words by the Syriac text. But that process is complicated by the nature of Syriac\
  \ writing. So the SEDRA API will lookup words for consonantal, partially vocalized,\
  \ and fully vocalized Syriac text. Using the word Id will provide the most accurate\
  \ results as the exact word will be returned. Fully vocalized text will provide\
  \ the next most accurate result. The least accurate results will be returned by\
  \ partially vocalized and consonantal Syriac words in that order. Following are\
  \ some samples to help understand how this works.\n1. By Word Id [30862](https://sedra.bethmardutho.org/api/word/30862.json)\n\
  2. By fully vocalized Syriac word [ܐܰܒܳܪܳܐ](https://sedra.bethmardutho.org/api/word/ܐ\
  ܰܒܳܪܳܐ.json)\n3. By partially vocalized Syriac word [ܐܶܒܪܐ](https://sedra.bethmardutho.org/api/word/ܐ\
  ܶܒܪܐ.json)\n4. By consonantal Syriac word [ܐܒܪܐ](https://sedra.bethmardutho.org/api/word/ܐ\
  ܒܪܐ.json)."
