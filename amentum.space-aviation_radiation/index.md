description: "Our atmosphere protects us from a hostile space radiation environment\
  \ comprising high energy particles of solar and intergalactic origin. Solar radiation\
  \ is significant during unpredictable and short lived solar flares and coronal mass\
  \ ejections (CMEs); however, galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) is omnipresent. The\
  \ GCR intensity varies with latitude, longitude, and time due to effects of solar\
  \ activity on the interplanetary magnetic field, as well as the Earth's magnetic\
  \ field. Space radiation collides with gases in the atmosphere, leading to a complex\
  \ shower of high energy radiation, the intensity and composition of which varies\
  \ spatially and temporally. Excessive exposure to radiation can damage DNA and lead\
  \ to long-term health effects such as an increased risk of cancer.  <br><br> Resulting\
  \ radiation levels at commercial aircraft altitudes are greater than at sea level.\
  \ Aircrew are classified as radiation workers in some countries; however, planning\
  \ to limit their exposure, and monitoring, is generally lacking. Both real-time\
  \ measurements and predictive models of radiation in the atmosphere are important\
  \ to mitigate the radiation risk to crew. <br><br>\nWe host a RESTful API to models\
  \ of cosmic ray induced ionising radiation in the atmosphere. \nThe CARI7 and PARMA\
  \ endpoints use models developed by the US Federal Aviation Administration and the\
  \ Japan Atomic Energy Agency to  calculate cosmic radiation doses at a point. \n\
  The Route Dose API calculates the same quantities along a great circle route between\
  \ two airports using CARI7. <br><br>\nAPI requests must contain a key \"API-Key\"\
  \ in the header (see code samples). Obtain a key from  <a href='https://developer.amentum.io'>here</a>.\

  \ survey <a href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/CTDTRBN\">here</a>.<br><br>\n\
