description: "The following are the specifications for the APIs to be implemented\
  \ at the Health Repository end if an entity is only serving the role of a HIP. The\
  \ specs are essentially duplicates from the Gateway and Health Repository, but put\
  \ together so as to make it clear to *HIPs* which set of APIs they should implement\
  \ to participate in the network. \n"
